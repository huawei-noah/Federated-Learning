The repository is for federated learning and transfer learning projects inside Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. Currently it includes:

* FairFL: a fair federated learning benchmarking framework that implements existing fair FL algorithms in the paper "[Proportional Fairness in Federated Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUHgEdWCQ)" by Guojun Zhang, Saber Malekmohammadi, Xi Chen and Yaoliang Yu. Comments are welcome!
* Hessian Alignment: domain generalization algorithms based on Hessian alignment (ICCV 2023). The related paper is "[Understanding Hessian Alignment for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11778)" by Sobhan Hemati*, Guojun Zhang*, Amir Estiri and Xi Chen. We have just released the code.
* Federated Domain Generalization: Incorporating domain generalization in the federated learning setting, based on the paper "[Mitigating Data Heterogeneity in Federated Learning with Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09979)" by Artur Back de Luca*, Guojun Zhang*, Xi Chen, Yaoliang Yu.

If you want to include your algorithms in one of our benchmarks, please make a pull request.

This open source project is not an official Huawei product, Huawei is not expected to provide support for this project.
