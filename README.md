The repository is for federated learning projects inside Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. Currently it includes:

* FairFL: a fair federated learning benchmarking framework that implements existing fair FL algorithms in the paper "[Proportional Fairness in Federated Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryUHgEdWCQ)" by Guojun Zhang, Saber Malekmohammadi, Xi Chen and Yaoliang Yu. Comments are welcome!
* Hessian Alignment: domain generalization algorithms based on Hessian alignment (ICCV 2023). Code will be out soon.
